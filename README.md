# Copula modeling of ROC and Predictiveness curves with survival outcomes
This repository contains code from the paper "Copula modeling for the estimation of measures of marker classification and predictiveness performance with survival outcomes". The code reproduces the results of the section: "Illustration: Application to the PBC dataset".

The computational implementations of the proposed methods were carried out using the R programming language. The R packages used are the following: copula, survival, sn, VGAM, flux, lattice, and gridExtra. For presentation proposes, the R code is embedded in a jupyter notebook.
